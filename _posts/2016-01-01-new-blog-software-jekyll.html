title: New Blog Software - Jekyll
---

After three years of using <a href=“https://wordpress.org/“ target=“_blank”>Wordpress</a> as my underlaying blog software, I decided it was time to move my blogging to a service less extensive.

After some research I decided to give <a href=“http://jekyllrb.com/“ target=“_blank”>Jekyll</a> a try as more and more people in my Twitter stream seem to use it.

<h3>What is Jekyll</h3>

Jekyll is an <a href=“https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll” target=“_blank”>open-source software</a> solution to create static web content by parsing e.g. markdown files inside a file system’s directory. 
It runs on your local machine and can deploy the static sites to Github Pages. Originally developed to power <a href=“https://pages.github.com/“ target=“_blank”>Github Pages</a> it is available to everyone and a great tool to create micro-blogs, that actually don’t need all the Wordpress/Plugin/Themes/etc. overhead.

<h3>Jekyll Github Pages Pricing?</h3>

$0

<h3>Installation</h3>

As easy as installing another <a href=“https://rubygems.org/“ target=“_blank”>Ruby gem</a> 

<code>gem install jekyll</code>

Playing around with it is highly recommended. It’s really fun with very fast results.

<h3>Configuration, Templates, Deployment</h3>

All of this is described <a href=“http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/“ target=“_blank”>here</a>.

It will take me another couple of days to finish migrating but I’m really excited to let you know once I hit the deploy button. Writing more regularly was one of my New Year’s resolutions.
